# Reducing Hotel Cancellation Rates

The goal of the project was to address the challenge of high hotel cancellation rates by developing predictive models using logistic regression and decision trees. The chosen model for implementation was logistic regression due to its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Objective:
The primary objective was to create models that could accurately predict the likelihood of a hotel booking being canceled. By understanding the factors influencing cancellations, hotels could proactively manage reservations and optimize resource allocation.

## Data Collection:
A comprehensive dataset was collected, encompassing a range of features such as booking source, lead time, room type, and historical cancellation patterns. This dataset provided the necessary information to train and validate the predictive models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Prior to model development, an exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain insights into the distribution of features, identify potential correlations, and understand patterns within the dataset. EDA played a crucial role in guiding feature selection and preprocessing.

## Feature Engineering:
Based on insights from EDA, relevant features were selected and engineered to enhance the predictive power of the models. This step involved transforming and creating variables that better captured the complexities of the hotel booking process.

## Logistic Regression Model:
A logistic regression model was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. This model was trained on the dataset to predict the probability of a booking resulting in a cancellation. Coefficients from the logistic regression aided in understanding the impact of each feature on the cancellation likelihood.

## Decision Trees for Ensemble Learning:
To improve model performance, a decision tree model was implemented. Decision trees excel in capturing nonlinear relationships and interactions among features. The decision tree model was incorporated into an ensemble learning framework, further enhancing the overall predictive accuracy.

## Model Evaluation and Validation:
Both the logistic regression and decision tree models were rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The models were validated on a separate dataset to ensure generalizability.

## Business Impact:
The logistic regression model successfully identified influential factors in hotel cancellations, offering valuable strategic insights. These insights empowered hotel management to implement targeted interventions, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance the overall customer booking experience.

## Conclusion:
By employing logistic regression as the core modeling technique, this data science project delivered a practical solution to the pervasive challenge of hotel booking cancellations. The insights gleaned from the model serve as a foundation for data-driven decision-making, allowing the hotel industry to proactively address and reduce cancellation rates.
